- peer to peer cash system
    sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. no middle man.
    Byzantine Generals Probs
- hash based
    The network timestamps transactions by hasing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work. forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.
- proof of work
     prevent double spending.
    The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed. but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU  power.

with the posssibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.

transactions section

To modify a past block, an attacker would have to redo the proof of work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and supass the work of the honest nodes.

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on exending it.
